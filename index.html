          <p>Teaching is AMAIZING! It really is. It combines learning, fun, laughter, development and acquirement of higher thinking skills. But you see, all of the mentioned before are true, not for the teacher tho.</p>
          <p>Teaching for teachers is completely different<br> For teachers teaching is :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pain</li>
            <li>Sleep depravation</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>IT SO FUN !!</em></p>

      <h2>Beginning</h2>
        <article>
          <p>You probably never wanted to be a teacher, right?</p>
          <p> It's common for English literature graduates to work such a laboring and consuming job, it's the universal law I guess.</p>
          <p> Others do it because they are good at English; even tho they haven't studied it academically; but oh well, who cares?</p>
          <p>If we wanna list the types,<br> they would go as follows :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The English graduate</li>
            <li>The "I just wanna make some money before I graduate from my whatever university" person</li>
            <li>The "I wanna be an English teacher omg!", usually a girl.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The third type is usually a girl who got affected by some hardworking, dead inside teacher and has no idea what teaching is or about.</p>
          <p><em>You go girl!</em><p>

      <h2>Your Boss</h2>
        <article>
          <p>English institutions managers always talk about <em><strong>Passion</strong></em>,<em><strong>Hard Work</strong></em> and how teachhing is <em><strong>tHe mOsT nOOble jOb</strong></em>. Well, that's absolute sugarcoated bullshit.
          <p>Let me tell you the types of these managers :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Money loving psychopaths</li>
            <li>Money loving psychopaths</li>

          <article>
          <p>I told you just know about the honest, loving and hardworking managers, didn't I? So of course you would expect a high salary, right?

      <h2>THE LOVELY STUDENTS</h2>
        <article>
          <p>The most important part of teaching is the students.</p><p> You will meet many different people, in personality, characters and backgrounds.</p><p>Wait..you're thinking this is a good thing? Of course not you silly new inexperienced teacher!<br>
          You have to deal with all of these 3 things! Have fun!</p>

      <h2>The moment of Epiphany</h2>
        <article>
          <p>During your first experience, you will probably start looking for a new place to work at. Remember that at this stage you have become experienced a bit and want a new oppotunity. And at the same time you know that teaching is just <em><strong>Shit!</strong></em>
          <p>You will go to an interview and maybe get accepted. The manager of the new place will probably want you to go through a new training period to test you he/she says. But it's really just about saving his money by giving you less money.</p>
          <p>In that period you will see that teaching suckes no matter where you go. And that moment of epiphany will come to you and then you will realize that <em>You don't want to be a teacher anymore.</em>
